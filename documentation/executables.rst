Executables
===========

Linux
-----

The Linux executables are dynamically linked and require a Glibc-based OS
distribution from 2022 or later (Ubuntu 22.04+, RHEL 9+, or derivatives). For
older Glibc-based OS distributions and non-Glibc-based OS distributions
(Alpine, etc...), please install the Python package instead.

Other Platforms
---------------

The macOS and Windows executables should work on any recent version of their
respective operating systems.
